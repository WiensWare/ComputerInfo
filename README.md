# ComputerInfo

This is a .NET library that allows one to easily retreive tons of various computer information such as serial number, attached monitors, installed software and much more.

## Getting Started

Reference the 32-bit or 64-bit DLL.  The 64-bit DLL is recommended if you'll be retreiving installed software.  The 32-bit version only returns the 32-bit installed software where as the 64-bit version returns both.

## Prerequisites

Requires at minimum the Microsoft .Net Framework 4.0.  Future versions work.

## Testing the Library

A test project is included to test most of the capabilities of the library.  It demonstrates calling the library and also the output of the various methods.
